# Nigerians in Munich - Tech Meetup

> A means to manage a small community tech meetup (mostly 9jas in Munich and its environs). 

We meet once a month to discuss and educate ourselves on the technologies and tools we use for our work, how to navigate the work culture in Germany, and support each other to grow our tech careers. 

## How does this work.

Most communication is done in the WhatsApp group, but we use this repository to propose ideas and topics. To propose a topic, follow these steps:

1. Create an issue with the title of the talk/topic.
2. Fill in a convincing description. Include your name, audience level, and how long the talk should last in the description.
3. Add the label `proposal` to issue.
4. Post it in the WhatsApp Channel and ask for votes. 

The maintainers will also occasionally ask community members to vote of topics. The maintainers also select topics based on upvotes and speaker availability (or preparedness).

If you have a topic you'd like to learn about, follow the same steps but label it as `suggestion`.

### Meeting Schedule

Meeting will be held at least once a month and will be communicated via PR and also on WhatsApp. If you're interested in follwing the updates, we suggest you watch the channel.
